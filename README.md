# Arable-Data-Automation
### About
This summer I worked with Princeton's High Meadow's Environmental Institute to gather and process data about different agricultural practices around the state of New Jersey.

This repository holds the code that was used for automating the data processing. It gathers data from remote field sensors made by Arable, exports it using the Arable API, processes it into a new CSV format, and uploads it to Google Drive with the Drive API so our team can all view it.  

### Status
My internship will continue until the end of the summer, so this project is still a work in progress and will be adapted depending on what the team needs.
